Maximum Rows Covered by Columns

You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix and an integer numSelect.
Your goal is to select exactly numSelect distinct columns from matrix such that you cover as many rows as possible.
A row is considered covered if all the 1's in that row are also part of a column that you have selected. If a row does not have any 1s, it is also considered covered.
More formally, let us consider selected = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect} as the set of columns selected by you. A row i is covered by selected if:
For each cell where matrix[i][j] == 1, the column j is in selected.
Or, no cell in row i has a value of 1.
Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a set of numSelect columns.
