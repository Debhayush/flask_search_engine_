Camelcase Matching

Given an array of strings queries and a string pattern, return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is true if queries[i] matches pattern, and false otherwise.
A query word queries[i] matches pattern if you can insert lowercase English letters into the pattern so that it equals the query. You may insert a character at any position in pattern or you may choose not to insert any characters at all.
